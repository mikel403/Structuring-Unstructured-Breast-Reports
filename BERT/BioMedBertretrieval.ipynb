High density and heterogeneous breasts (ACR c) which significantly reduces the sensitivity for the detection of underlying lesions. However, there are no obvious nodules, parenchymal distortions or suspicious calcifications. Benign calcifications in left breast. Breast ultrasound: Ultrasound study of both breasts is performed with a high frequency linear probe in which heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue is observed. Bilateral millimetric simple cysts, some with echogenic content. Minimal bilateral ductal ectasia. The nodule already known and biopsied in 2017 located in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast with pathological anatomical result of fibroadenoma persists. In the current study, a circumscribed, hypoechoic, lobulated, 6-7 mm, lobulated nodule is visualized in 12 h of the right breast, which could correspond to a cyst with contents but it is advisable to perform Fine Needle Aspiration to confirm its liquid nature. conclusion: BI-RADS® 3.

Results. Radiological breast pattern with balance between fibroglandular and adipose tissue, scattered throughout the breast. Focal asymmetry with a tendency to nodularity and imprecise contours located in the upper quadrants of the right breast in the oblique mid-lateral projection not visible in the craniocaudal projection. Calcifications, with morphological criteria of benignity. Axillary lymph nodes, non-specific on imaging. The ultrasound study shows in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, practically in the axillary tail, a rounded hypoechoic nodule with irregular contours and peripheral hyperechogenic halo, with a maximum axis of approximately 9 mm, highly suggestive of malignancy (BI-RADS category 5). We recommend magnetic resonance and percutaneous Image-Guided Biopsy with ultrasound guidance.
